# Structured modelling with context managers and gurobi

This project serves as an example of how you can use context managers to construct your gurobi model. 
The example used is a knapsack problem where you have three top level constraints that can be combined in several different ways.

```bash
#> python knapsack.py volume
#> python knapsack.py weight
#> python knapsack.py value

```
